	<p>I investigate large-scale systems, services, and applications operating across the interconnected environments of cloud, edge, and NextG networks. This includes designing smart AI systems (edge AI, federated/distributed ML, generative AI), optimizing edge/cloud computing (resource/data/workload management, service delivery, emerging communication infrastructures), advancing energy systems (data center decarbonization, demand response, EV-grid synergy), fortifying cybersecurity (DDoS mitigation, anomaly detection), and innovating for multimedia experiences (VR, streaming, gaming, social networks). At its core, my work applies principles of network optimization and control, alongside tools such as learning and game theory, systematically integrating computer science with engineering mathematics. This interdisciplinary approach enables rigorous modeling, design, analysis, implementation, and experiments focused on ensuring system efficiency, scalability, sustainability, and resilience. My research has been supported by grants from the <a href="//www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>, including the CAREER award, and the industry.</p>
	
	<p>I am a research associate professor at the <a href="//uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>, working with the <a href="//ccsp.uoregon.edu/">Center for Cyber Security and Privacy</a>. Previously I worked at <a href="//www.bell-labs.com">Nokia Bell Labs</a> in Ireland. I completed my Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) degree in computer science (Informatik) at the University of Göttingen (<a href="//www.uni-goettingen.de/">Georg-August-Universität Göttingen</a>), Germany, where my work was part of EU projects. I received the <a href="//ripple.com">Ripple</a> Faculty Fellowship, the Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs UK and Ireland Recognition Award, and the Best Paper Awards of IEEE CNS 2019 and IEEE LANMAN 2013. I was a guest editor of JSAC, and have also served in many program committee roles, including as a track chair for ICDCS, as a member for conferences like INFOCOM, MOBIHOC, ICDCS, and WWW, and as a chair for multiple workshops with INFOCOM and ICDCS.</p>

 			<blockquote><p id="quote_texts">Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed. The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him. A vapour, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But, if the universe were to crush him, man would still be more noble than that which killed him, because he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him; the universe knows nothing of this. All our dignity consists then in thought. By it we must elevate ourselves, and not by space and time which we cannot fill. Let us endeavour then to think well; this is the principle of morality.</p>
